## CSS Flexbox
1. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.

2. Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.

The main axis is the one set by your flex-direction property. Flex items move as a group on the main axis. 

The cross axis runs in the othe direction to the main axis, so if flex-direction is row the cross axis runs along the column. Here you can move things individually or as a group. 

3. How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?

When using any properties that reorder the visual display away from how things are odered in the HTMl doc it can negavtively impact accessibilty. The logical order is the order that the screen reader will read out hte content and the reordering only happens for the visual order, not the logical order.
