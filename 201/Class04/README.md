## CSS Layout: Normal Flow CSS Layout: Positioning

1. What is meant by “normal flow”?
Normal flow is the default layout for CSS elements. By default a block level elements content fills the available inline space of the parent element containing it and the element grows along the block dimension to accommodate its content. 

The size of the inline elements is just the size of their content. You cant set the height or width on inline elements. Images can be resized tho without changin their display property. 
The normaal layout flow is the system by which elements are placed inside the browsers viewport. 

For example: block-level elements are laid out vertically. 


2. What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?

Unlike inline elements you can set the width and height of block elements. 

Inline elements dont appear on new lines, they all sit on the same line along with the adjacent or wrapped text content.

Block level elements appear on a new line below the last one. 

3. ___ positioning is the default for every html element.

## Misc

1. Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.

Learning from fellow students and job interview readiness. 
I often hear developers and engineers talk about how difficult interviews can be. This could help me get a leg up on the competition. I think I learn better from my peers becuase we are often starting at the same level. 

Pair programming could help me with hearing and interpreting the vocabulary that Im learning as well as producing from scratch a meaningful well structured solution.
