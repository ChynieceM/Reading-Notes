## Getting Started



1. Compose a short poem describing how HTTP sends data between computers.

HTTP, my friend, needs a favor, he said hey man I need to get a message to dee dee.  Pass this message along so I can use the phone. 

I cant get this message to my friend of a friend cuz they dont know what language its in. 

But good thing we can drink this goop so he can get the scoop. And then send the message to my dog in a chicken coop. 

2. Describe how HTML, CSS, and JS files are “parsed” in the browser.

When the browser requests servers for HTML files, HTML files will have a link element referenceing CSS and JS. The browser searches the HTML file and recognizes any link elements referencing CSS stylsheets and script elements referencing script elements

After the browser parses the HTMl it sends requests back to the server for CSS files and JS files it found and then parses the CSS and JS.

The browser generates an in memory DOM tree from the parsed files and a in memory CSSOM structure from the parsed CSS and compiles and executes the parsed JS. 

As the browser builds the DOM tree and applies the styles from teh CSSOM tree and executes the JS, a visual representation of the page is painted to the screen and the user sees the page content and can interact with it.
