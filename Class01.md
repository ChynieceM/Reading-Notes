## How to customize notes (edit and create, bold heading etc) We used [Markdown Guide] (https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

Headings use hashtags to indicate size. For smaller headings use multiple hashtags. Ex. Heading Level 1 Largest all the way to Heading Level 6. For level 6 use 6#'s.

To create a paragraph - use a new line to seperate multiple lines of text 
DONT put TABS or spaces in your lines, keep them all left aligned

##### Add emphasis my making text Bold and Italicized

For bolding text use TWO asterisks or underscores before and after the word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word put two asterisks with no spaces. 
So for Loveisbold put TWO asterisks before and after is with no space
**Love**
L**o**ve
 
For Italics use ONE asterisk or underscore before or after the word or phrase.
To italicize the middle of a word put ONE asterisk before and after the word or phrase with no spaces around the word.
*Love*
L*o*ve

To use bold and italics at the same time use THREE asterisks before and after the word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word use THREE asterisks with no spaces around the word
An alternative is to use one asterisk by the word follwed by two undersorces. Or use one underscore by the word with two asterisks.
***Love***
or __*Love*__
**_Love_**
 
##### Blockquotes + Blockquotes with multiple paragraphs
 
To create a Blockquote, add a greater than sign > in front of the paragraph (text)
 
To create a Blockwuote with multiple paragraphs use a > sign before each paragraph and on the blank line between the paragraphs.
 
To create Nested block quotes or a quote within a quote add a double greater than sign >> in front of the paragraph you want to nest 
It should look like 
> I like apples
> 
>> I also like pears 

##### Blockquotes & other elementss

To create Bullets use a dash - and space before the paragraph, to use a block quote and large heading with nested bullets it will look like this
