## How to use markdown syntax (note-taking)
##### We used [Markdown Guide] (https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

Headings use hashtags to indicate size. For smaller headings use multiple hashtags. Ex. Heading Level 1 Largest all the way to Heading Level 6. For level 6 use 6#'s.

To create a paragraph - use a new line to seperate multiple lines of text 
DONT put TABS or spaces in your lines, keep them all left aligned

##### Add emphasis my making text Bold and Italicized

For bolding text use TWO asterisks or underscores before and after the word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word put two asterisks with no spaces. 
So for Loveisbold put TWO asterisks before and after is with no space
**Love**
L**o**ve
 
For Italics use ONE asterisk or underscore before or after the word or phrase.
To italicize the middle of a word put ONE asterisk before and after the word or phrase with no spaces around the word.
*Love*
L*o*ve

To use bold and italics at the same time use THREE asterisks before and after the word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word use THREE asterisks with no spaces around the word
An alternative is to use one asterisk by the word follwed by two undersorces. Or use one underscore by the word with two asterisks.
***Love***
or __*Love*__
**_Love_**
 
##### Blockquotes + Blockquotes with multiple paragraphs
 
To create a Blockquote, add a greater than sign > in front of the paragraph (text)
 
To create a Blockwuote with multiple paragraphs use a > sign before each paragraph and on the blank line between the paragraphs.
 
To create Nested block quotes or a quote within a quote add a double greater than sign >> in front of the paragraph you want to nest 
It should look like 

> I like apples
> 
>> I also like pears 

##### Blockquotes & other elementss

To create Bullets use a dash - and space before the paragraph, to use a block quote and large heading with nested bullets it will look like this 
(put blank lines before and after block quotes for best practice)

> #### This looks great
> 
>> - **This looks great too!**

##### Lists

To create an ordered list add number and periods like this
1. A
2. B
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Indented item

To create an uordered list or a bullet use a dash or a plus like this
- hello
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-indented hello
+ hello

Also dont use different delimeters in the same list

##### Adding elements in the list

- Lets add a blockquote to this list
> I also indented this blockquote or use four spaces

##### Code Blocks

When using code blocks use four spaces or indent, if they are in a list use eight spaces or TWO indents 
It will look like 
-This is the code
<html>
To denote a word or phrase as code use back ticks `
use one or more back ticks to escape a back tick ``
 
##### Horizontal Rules
 
To create a Horizontal rule use three or more asterisks, underscores, or dashes
***
---
___
 
PUT BLANK LINES BEFORE and AFTER Horizontal
 
##### Links
 
To create a link put the link in text brackets and then put the URl in parenthesis
eg [text] (URl)
 
To add a title to the link use quotes around the test you want, it'll appear as a tool tip for when someone hovers over the link 
it should look like this [text] (URL) "what you want the tool tip to be"
 
###### URLs and Emails

To turn an email or url into a link use less than sign <
<email@email.org>
<www.ok.ccc>

To emphasize links add asterists before and after parenthesis and brackets
To denote links as code add backticks to in the parenthesis and brackets
**[text] (text)** to bold 
*[text] (text)* to italicize
Reference style links are special in the sense it makes it easier for markdown to be read
the first part looks like this [text] [label]: 
the second part looks like this https:address. com "text"  

For example to make this easier to read in a paragraph it should look like this
I went to the grocery store the other day and I got so much [food][1].
[1]: <https://kroger. c o m> "grocery store I went to"
  
Additionally spaces in a URl arent recognizable so use 20% ex. www.hello.ccc/hello20%go20%
