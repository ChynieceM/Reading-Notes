## Consider the history: That Time When Women Stopped Coding

What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?
-The article suggests that the decline of women in computer science began at the same time as personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers. The importance of this timing is that personal computers were mainly being marketed to, and used by, boys and men. This created a narrative that computers and technology were primarily for males, which was further amplified by popular culture, as seen in the movies of that era where the "awkward geek boy genius" was a common trope.
Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
-Familiarity with Computers: Kids who had access to computers at home would have naturally become more familiar with them. They would have been more comfortable with computers, understood them better, and would have likely developed an early interest in how computers work.
-Learning Curve: When kids who have been using computers from an early age enter computer science classes, they already have a foundation of knowledge that those who haven't used computers do not. This can make the learning curve for those without that experience much steeper, as Patricia Ordóñez's story illustrates.
-Changing Assumptions: By the 1980s, computer science professors began to assume that their students had grown up playing with computers at home. Therefore, the teaching was skewed towards those with prior experience, leaving behind those who didn't have the same level of exposure to computers.

## Ask the question: Why diversity matters to your tech company

When are diversity efforts most successful?
-Diversity efforts are most successful when they're driven by a commitment from company leaders. This includes understanding the importance of diversity, communicating its importance within the organization, and making strategic decisions that promote diversity and inclusion.
Why do diverse companies perform better?
-Diverse teams are often smarter and more creative. The different perspectives and experiences brought by diverse individuals can lead to more innovative problem-solving. Moreover, research indicates a strong correlation between diversity and positive financial outcomes. For instance, a 2011 study found that female representation in top management can lead to an increase of $42 million in firm value. Similarly, a 2003 study found racial diversity was tied to better financial performance in banks focused on innovation.
Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.
-An example given in the article of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base involves YouTube. When the developer team, who were almost entirely right-handed, built the iOS app without considering how left-handed people would use it, 5% to 10% of videos were uploaded upside down as a result. This example illustrates that having a diverse development team could have potentially prevented this issue, as the needs and perspectives of a wider range of users would have been taken into account during the development process.
