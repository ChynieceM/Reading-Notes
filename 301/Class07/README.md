## Pair programming

1. What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?
-improved code quality
-enhanced learning
-increased collaboration
-better project management
-improved focus
-higher job satisfaction

2. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
- improved code quality, enhanced learning, and increased collaboration to be the most beneficial aspects of pair programming. By working closely with a partner, I have been able to identify and correct mistakes more efficiently, learn from my partner's experience and knowledge, and develop a stronger working relationship with my team members.

3. How does pair programming work?
-Pair programming typically involves two developers working on the same codebase at the same time, sharing a computer and keyboard. One individual serves as the "driver" and is responsible for typing code while the other serves as the "navigator" and is responsible for reviewing the code and providing guidance.
