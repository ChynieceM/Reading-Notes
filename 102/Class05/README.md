# CSS - Cascading Style Sheet

**What is CSS?** 

Cascading Style Sheets is the style and look of a webpage. It controls how HTML elements look in the browser.

CSS is a language specifying how documents are presented to users - how they are styled, laid out, etc.

CSS can be used for very basic document text styling - for ex. changing the color, size of headings and links. It can be used to create a layout etc. 

It can also be used for animation.

**CSS Syntax**

CSS is a rule based language - ***you define the rules by specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements on your web page. 

For example, you can have a main heading on your page to be shown as a large red text. 
>
> `h1 {`
>    `color: red;`
> `font-size: 5em;`
>`}`
>
>>* In this example the CSS rule opens with a **selector**. This *selects* the HTML element that we are going to style. The h1 heading
>>* We then have a set of curly braces { }
>>* Inside the braces we have one or more **declarations**, which includes **property** and **value** pairs. We specify the *property* (color in this example) before the colon, and then we specify the value of the property after the colon (red in this example).
>>* This ex. has 2 declarations, one for `color` and the other for `font-size`. Each pair specifies a property of the element we are selecting `h1`, and then a value we would like to give the property.
