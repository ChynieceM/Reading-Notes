## Choosing a Text Editor

Choosing a text editor is a personal choice, synonymous to sport teams etc.

##### What is a Text Editor?

* software that you can download or access on the web
* you can write or manage text
* text that helps build a website

The most **important** features of a txt editor 
1. *code completion* - offers suggestions based on what you typed; allows you to write code faster and make sure you are writing the code

2. *syntax highlighting* - colorizing the text you type; makes it easier to find errors

3. variety of *themes* - change colors and text; this reduces eye strain so using a **dark** theme and bright color text

4. can choose from variety of *extensions* when most needed - extensions are plug-ins for text edior; adds functionality

#### Using Software on Your Machine

On Mac there's *text edit*; on Windows theres *Notepad*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Linux each distribution has its own editor and may go by different names

The text editors that come on your computer dont have features  - they are bare bones 

***CAVEATS*** to using the text editor that comes on the computer
* create the code in a plain text editor
* plain text has no formatting options  - so you shouldnt see options for bold, underline, or italics
* ***CODE IN PLAIN TEXT***

**Tips**
* When using the text editor that comes on the computer 

1. Create a folder somewhere to store entire website. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you create new documents save those files to that folder or sub-folders withing the main folder

2. When saving your files, have the appropriate extensions; ex. .html, .css,

#### Third-Party Options

**Software examples**
Notepad++, text wrangler, BB Edit, Brackets, Visual Studio Code, Atom, Brackets, Sublime Text. 
* Notepad++ is for windows only - syntax hihglighting, code + word + function completion, chat rooms for questions with online comm. 
* Text Wrangler is for Mac only
- but **retired**, you can use BB Edit some features are free but full use costs
* Visual Studio - all Mac and PC made by Microsoft
* Atom - made by GitHub
* Brackets - made by Adobe, all Mac and PC. only supports HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Other languages can be added through extns.

##### Text Editors VS IDEs

A text editor edits and wrangles text

An **IDE** or ***Integrated Development Environment*** is a suite of all different kind of software coming together 
* It's a text edior, file manager, compiler, and debugger in one. Kind of like Microsoft Outlook
