##### **Growth Mindset**

For me, a *growth mindset* means to focus on **progress** and take baby steps to reach my goals. It also means being tenacious and staying **motivated** but taking breaks when needed. Simply put, doing what you need to get things done. 


###### 3 Reminders to maintain a *Growth Mindset*


> 1. Make a list of my accomplishments
>
> 2. Think of this quote 
>> *Motivation gets you growing but discipline keeps you growing* -John C. Maxwell
>
> 3. Think about someone with the career I'd like to emulate.
