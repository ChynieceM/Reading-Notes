# Wire Frame 

### 1. What is a wireframe?

**Wireframing** is used by U designers and helps them define and plan information hierarchy of the design for a website, app, or product. Basically an outline or sketch. 

* Wireframes help designers or clients focus on how they want users to process information, based on user research. 

* You want to know how all of the information is gonna look in plain black and white before coding anytning. 

* An argument for wireframing is if a user doesnt know where to go on a plain hand drawn diagram of your site page, then colors and fancy text is irrelevant. 

***Some example of wireframes are***: softwares like invision or Balsmiq.

* Advantages of paper and pencil are they can be easily changed; switching later to software allows you to keep track of more detailed exchange decisions

### 2. Consider this before wireframing

Deciding to use paper and pen or an online tool to wireframe depends more on what the end goal is. 

> ex. deciding which method depends on if you are more focused on visual design in a project or how much uncertainity there is re whats being designed

>> examples of the structure process: 
>> * Wireframe > interactive prototype > visual > Design
>> * Sketch > Code
>> Sketch > Wireframe > Hi-Def Wireframe >Visual > Code 

### 3. 6 steps to wireframing

1. **Do you research** - Understand who your audience is by way of user reasearch, detailing requirements, creating user personas, defiing use cases. Carry out an **analysis** of similar product lines 

2. **Prepare your research for quick reference** - create a cheatsheet with your goals (requirements), personas, use cases, and reminders. 

3. **Map out user flow** - wireframing gets messy if you dont have an idea of how many screens you need to produce the flow you expect users to follow. 

* Have a tight concept of where your users will be coming from `(which marketing channels, and what messaging)`, and where you need them to end up. 

* Good **information architecture** will ensure that users are self sufficient, *are asking less questions on how to do something that should be simple*, lower levels of user frustration *leads to more levels of trust* and lowers drop off/out rates 

4. **Draft, dont draw. Sketch, don't illustrate**

* Remember you are outlining and representing features and formats not illustrating in fine detail. **Don't think about aesthetics and colors** just yet. The UI designer can deal with that. ***Use a thick marker to prevent you from drowning yourself in detail*** 

**Focus on these questions** when sketching: 

* How can you organise the content to support user goals?

* Which info should be most prominent? Where should the main message go? What should the user see first when going to the page?

* What will the user expect to see on certain areas of the page? 

* Which buttons or touch points does the user need to complete desired actions? 

5. **Add some detail and get to testing**

Add some informational details to prepare your wireframe for its upgrade, megatron-style, to prototype-mode.

Add detail in the way you would process a screen or book. Top to bottom, left to right. ***Here you are adding content, not the muscle just yet***. 

6. **Turn wireframes into prototypes** 

You can now import your wireframes into a prototyping tool.

UX, UI, -- UX is the overall feel 
ex. Git desktop, git web browser, and git command line is the user experience and the user interaction is thinking about doing things on the website or desktop.
