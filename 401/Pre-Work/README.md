2. What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

Following the think like a programmer:

Understand: Before trying to solve a problem, make sure you fully understand it. This involves being able to explain it in plain English or visually represent it.

Plan: Before diving into problem-solving, plan your solution. This includes specifying the steps needed to transform the input into the desired output. Comments in your code can be a useful tool for planning.

Divide: Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable sub-problems. Solve these sub-problems individually and then connect these solutions to solve the original, larger problem

 - try debugging step by step, reassessing the problem from a different perspective, or researching to see if someone else has already solved a similar problem.
