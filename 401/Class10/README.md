1. Stacks: Stacks can be likened to a stack of pancakes. The way you typically add and remove pancakes from your stack follows a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) process. You place a new pancake on top of the stack (push operation in terms of data structure). When you take a pancake to eat, you usually take the one from the top of the stack (pop operation). You can't remove a pancake from the bottom without moving all the others on top, just like in a stack data structure.

2. Queues: Queues can be compared to a line of people waiting at a bank. The first person who arrives is the first person to be served. This is a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) process. When a new person arrives, they join the end of the queue (enqueue operation). When a person is served, they leave from the front of the queue (dequeue operation). Just as in a queue data structure, you can't easily remove a person from the middle of the line without disrupting the order.
