## Entity Framework and APIs

ASP.NET Core MVC: This is a framework for building web applications using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. This pattern separates the application into three main components: the model, the view, and the controller. The model manages the data, logic, and rules of the application. The view handles the display of information. The controller manages the input from the user and sends commands to the model and view.

Entity Framework Core: Entity Framework (EF) Core is an object-relational mapper (ORM) that simplifies data access in your application. It enables .NET developers to work with a database using .NET objects, and eliminates the need for most of the data-access code that developers usually need to write.

Controllers and Views in ASP.NET Core MVC: In ASP.NET Core MVC, controllers are responsible for defining the methods that handle HTTP requests, while views are responsible for rendering the HTML that is sent to the client.

SQL Server LocalDB: This is a lightweight version of SQL Server Express that has fewer features and is simpler to install and use. It's intended for developers to use in local development environments.

Inheritance in the data model: This refers to the ability for one model (or "class") to inherit properties and methods from another. This can be useful for reducing redundancy in your code and making it more maintainable.

Raw SQL Queries: Entity Framework Core allows you to bypass the LINQ syntax and execute raw SQL queries directly against the database. This can be useful when you need to perform complex queries that are difficult or inefficient to express with LINQ.

Dynamic LINQ: This is a library that extends LINQ by providing string-based query capabilities. This can be useful when you need to construct queries dynamically, such as in a search function where the user can specify multiple search terms and conditions.

Visual Studio: This is a comprehensive IDE (Integrated Development Environment) developed by Microsoft. It provides tools for designing, writing, and debugging code in various languages, including C#, the language typically used with ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework Core.
