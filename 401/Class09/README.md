## Language Integrated Computers 

- Language-Integrated Query (LINQ): LINQ integrates query capabilities directly into the C# language. Instead of expressing queries as simple strings, LINQ offers type checking at compile time and IntelliSense support. This means you can use the same query language for different types of data sources such as SQL databases, XML documents, various Web services, etc.

- Query expressions: Query expressions are a significant part of LINQ and are written in a declarative query syntax. This allows for easy filtering, ordering, and grouping operations on data sources with minimal code. Query expressions can be used with SQL databases, ADO.NET Datasets, XML documents and streams, and .NET collections.

- Query execution: A query is not executed until you iterate over the query variable, usually in a foreach statement. At compile time, query expressions are converted to Standard Query Operator method calls as per the C# specification.

- Query syntax and method syntax: While both can express the same queries, it's generally recommended to use query syntax due to its readability and conciseness. Some query operations, however, don't have an equivalent query expression clause and must be expressed as a method call. Both syntax types can be combined.

- Compilation of query expressions: Depending on the type that the query is applied to, query expressions can be compiled to expression trees or to delegates. IEnumerable `<T>` queries are compiled to delegates, while IQueryable and IQueryable `<T>` queries are compiled to expression trees.

- Enabling LINQ querying of data sources: For in-memory data, if the data type implements IEnumerable `<T>`, you can query the data using LINQ to Objects. For remote data, the best option is to implement the IQueryable `<T>` interface.

- IQueryable LINQ providers: The complexity of these providers can vary. Less complex providers might interface with a single method of a web service, while more complex ones, such as LINQ to SQL provider, can translate complete LINQ queries to an expressive query language like SQL.



- Language-Integrated Query (LINQ) is a technology that offers a consistent model for working with data across various kinds of data sources and formats. In a LINQ query, you are always working with objects, making the process of querying various data sources more uniform.

LINQ query operations have three distinct parts:

Obtain the data source: Data sources must support the generic IEnumerable `<T>` interface to be queryable with LINQ. A query is executed in a foreach statement, which requires IEnumerable or IEnumerable `<T>`. LINQ providers represent non-queryable types as such.

- Create the query: This step involves specifying the information to be retrieved from the data source. Optionally, the query can also specify how that information should be sorted, grouped, and shaped before it is returned. C# provides a new query syntax to make writing queries easier. The important point is that in LINQ, the query variable itself takes no action and returns no data. It just stores the information required to produce the results when the query is executed.

- Execute the query: The actual execution of the query is deferred until you iterate over the query variable in a foreach statement. This concept is known as deferred execution. The query results are retrieved during the foreach statement.

- Immediate execution of a query and caching its results can be forced by calling the ToList or ToArray methods. Queries that perform aggregation functions like Count, Max, Average, and First are also executed immediately as they need to iterate over the elements to return a result. These types of queries return a single value, not an IEnumerable collection.


- This comprehensive article provides an overview of standard query operators in C#. These operators form the basis of the Language Integrated Query (LINQ) pattern. Most of these methods operate on sequences - objects whose types implement the IEnumerable `<T>` or IQueryable `<T>` interfaces.

The LINQ standard query operators are categorized into two sets: one operating on objects of type IEnumerable `<T>`, and another operating on objects of type IQueryable `<T>`. These methods are defined as static members of the Enumerable and Queryable classes, respectively, and are set as extension methods of the types they operate on.

- Two methods from the Enumerable class, Cast `<TResult>` (IEnumerable) and OfType `<TResult>` (IEnumerable), are highlighted, which allow querying non-generic collections by creating a strongly-typed collection of objects. Similar methods are also present in the Queryable class, operating on IQueryable objects.

The operators differ in their execution timing, based on whether they return a singleton value or a sequence. Those returning a singleton value (like Average and Sum) execute immediately, while methods returning a sequence defer execution and return an enumerable object.

The article provides an example of using standard query operators to extract information from a sequence. It demonstrates the use of both query expression syntax and method-based query syntax.

- The article further delves into specific topics:

Query expression syntax: Some standard query operators have dedicated C# and Visual Basic language keyword syntax that enables them to be part of a query expression.
Extending the standard query operators: These operators can be enhanced with domain-specific methods or replaced with custom implementations.
Obtaining a data source: The first step in a LINQ query is specifying the data source.
Filtering: Common query operation to apply a Boolean expression filter.
Ordering: Sorts the returned data.
Grouping: Groups results based on a specified key.
Joining: Creates associations between sequences that are not explicitly modeled in the data sources.
Selecting (Projections): Specifies the shape or type of each returned element.
Lastly, the article provides a table correlating standard query operators to their equivalent query expression clauses in C#.


## writing queries in C# using LINQ

Setting up the project: The tutorial starts with creating a new Console Application project in Visual Studio, ensuring System.Linq is added to the namespace.

Creating an in-memory data source: An in-memory data source is created in the form of a list of Student objects. Each Student object includes first name, last name, ID, and a list of integer scores.

Creating a query: A simple query is written that returns all the Student objects where the first score is greater than 90.

Executing the query: A foreach loop is used to execute the query and output the results in the Console.

Modifying the query: The tutorial shows how to modify the query to add more filter conditions, order the results, and group the results.

Using var for implicitly typed variables: The use of the var keyword is explained for implicitly typed variables, which instructs the compiler to infer the types of variables.

Using 'let' keyword: The 'let' keyword is introduced to create an identifier for any expression result in the query expression. This can be used to enhance performance by storing the results of an expression so it doesn't have to be calculated multiple times.

Method syntax in a query: The tutorial ends by explaining how to use method syntax in a query expression, such as calculating the total score for each student and then calculating the average score of the class.
